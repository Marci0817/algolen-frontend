NFT Lending and Renting

## The Vision
Imagine a world where you can lend out your unused NFTs to generate passive income and rent out NFTs for short terms use.

You just joined a new NFT based game on Algorand, you are enjoying the game but don't have much time to play. Don't worry because at **Algolen** you can rent out a high level NFT and enjoy the endgame at your leisure. 

No need for long term commitments, renting is a fraction of the cost of buying the NFT at full price.

## The tech stack
- Frontend: SvelteKit (and Algokit Utils)
- Contract: Beaker (and Algokit Utils)
- Unit testing: Pytest
